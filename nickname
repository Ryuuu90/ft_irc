Clients
A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another server. Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique nickname. In addition to the nickname, all servers must have the following information about all clients: the real name/address of the host that the client is connecting from, the username of the client on that host, and the server to which the client is connected.

Nicknames are non-empty strings with the following restrictions:

They MUST NOT contain any of the following characters: space (' ', 0x20), comma (',', 0x2C), asterisk ('*', 0x2A), question mark ('?', 0x3F), exclamation mark ('!', 0x21), at sign ('@', 0x40).
They MUST NOT start with any of the following characters: dollar ('$', 0x24), colon (':', 0x3A).
They MUST NOT start with a character listed as a channel type, channel membership prefix, or prefix listed in the IRCv3 multi-prefix Extension.
They SHOULD NOT contain any dot character ('.', 0x2E).
